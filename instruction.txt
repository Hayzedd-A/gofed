üèóÔ∏è Project Goal

Create a full Next.js 15.5 application (in JavaScript) using the App Router that allows users to:

Submit a product-search form (with optional image).

The backend uses OpenAI/ChatGPT to analyze the image and combine its insights with other form data to search a MongoDB product database.

Display results in a compact list-style grid with image, title, and brand name.

Clicking an item opens a modal showing full product details and a ‚ÄúView on Website‚Äù button linking to the productUrl.

Provide an admin interface and API for managing (CRUD) products in the same MongoDB.

üß© Core Features

Next.js 15.5 App Router with Server Components, Route Handlers, Server Actions where appropriate.

Tailwind CSS for styling with a professional, responsive UI.

Futura PT font:

<link href="https://fonts.cdnfonts.com/css/futura-pt" rel="stylesheet">


Theme color: #2b3a55.

MongoDB + Mongoose for the Product model.

OpenAI API (ChatGPT Vision) for image analysis.

multer for image upload handling.

Axios or fetch for external calls.

Sharp (optional) for image resizing/optimization.

Full CRUD admin API + simple admin page for product management.

üß† Product Schema (/models/product.js)
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const ProductSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  productName: String,
  colorwayName: String,
  imageUrl: String,
  shortDescription: String,
  application: String,
  keywords: [String],
  colorPalette: [String],
  performance: String,
  specSheetLink: String,
  brandName: String,
  designerNote: String,
  productUrl: String,
  processed: { type: String, default: '' },
}, { timestamps: true });

module.exports = mongoose.models.Product || mongoose.model('Product', ProductSchema);


Include data/sample-products.json to seed the database.

üßæ Frontend Form Fields
{
  "email": "email",
  "projectname": "string",
  "sector": ["hospitality","corporate/workspace","healthcare","education","multi-family","cruise Line","senior living","others"],
  "budgetTier": ["budget","mid","luxury"],
  "keywords": "comma,separated,values",
  "image": "<file>"
}


sector, keywords, and optional image drive the search.

The full form (except image) is also POSTed to
https://hook.us2.make.com/naut5o6pqb67b9igrav3fwtkoggncxkd for marketing.

üîÑ Backend Flow

POST /api/products/search (multipart/form-data).

Validate inputs.

If image uploaded:

Save temporarily to /public/uploads.

Create a public URL ${NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL}/uploads/<filename>.

Send URL to OpenAI Vision (OPENAI_API_KEY).

Parse response to extract keywords/tags/colors.

Combine extracted image tags + form keywords + sector into a MongoDB $or query on fields:
productName, shortDescription, keywords, colorPalette, application, brandName.

Limit 20 results, sort by relevance.

Forward marketing payload to MARKETING_WEBHOOK_URL.

Delete temporary image in finally.

Return JSON {products: [...]}.

Admin API (/api/products/manage)

GET: list all products (paginated).

POST: add product.

PUT: update product by ID.

DELETE: remove product by ID.

Protect with simple ADMIN_TOKEN env variable header check (basic auth-like).

üñ•Ô∏è UI & Design Details

v2.
@gofed-groups

add new feature to this app as a v2
1. user account. while users can still search without logging in, there will be a user account such that, user can add to favourite and view their favourite products.
2. Add a small nav at the top where user can click the login or signup button if there are not logged in or click to view favourite or logout if logged in.
3. the login and signup should use a modal
4. a new page to show user's favourites
5. a favourite icon on each product to add to favourite, if user is not logged in, then pop up the login modal.


implement the complete user onboarding, authentication and favourite management.
