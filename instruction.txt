create a complete nextjs app for getting products from the database.
the frontend sends descriptions in form of keywords and an optional image to the backend,  
the backend uses chatgpt to process the image and then process the response to fetch the database.
the image will be first saved within the app folder and servered publicly to the chatgpt endpoint.


the chatgpt endpoint uses the getImageAnalysisForProductSearch function in functions.js, the sample response is included.
the product model is in the model/product.js

this is the sample data of the product, all the fields are not consistent with all the product.
